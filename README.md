An explosively awesome desktop/mobile frontend for Blackbaud, built off the Bromine API.

I would highly recommend using python 3.10 (atl i used that in testing).

run make uv and in another terminal tab run python3 lms.py

Edit makefile as necessary
### FAQ
#### How to install?
Get python (3.10 should work)
Install requirements (requirements.txt)
### IFAQ (Infrequently Frequently Asked Questions)
#### Why?
Since Blackbaud is dogshit
#### Why not just use the website?
Because the website is dogshit
#### Why not just use the app?
There is no app
#### Why not just use the mobile website?
Because the mobile website is dogshit
#### Why not just use the desktop website?
Because the desktop website is dogshit. I said that already.
#### Why not just use Gavin's Extension?
Gavin's Extension isn't bad, but it's kinda hacky. Mine is also kinda hacky, but it's a different kind of hacky.
#### Why not windows yet?
Yeah, it works on windows. I just haven't tested it yet. I'll get to it. If you want, send a PR (no need for tests [how the fuck would you implement tests?]). Also edit you makefile as needed. Please don't commit your makefile (if you do its fine);
#### Why is there two programming languages?
Basically, I didn't want to rewrite Ultraviolet (the proxy used for Google Authentication) when I made this, so uhh, have fun! And I wasn't going to write the rest of the app in JS, though DarkSystemGit (if he isn't working on Atto-24) should be responsible for the JS framework (still private, part of the Bromine Initiative (i havent even added all the api endpoints in this repo to it yet)
#### Why is the googleauth.py absolute garbage
I'll fix it eventually. It had to do with me debugging.




if something fucks up, send an issue. I'll get to it when I can.
maybe. (probably though, I want to make this polished.)
